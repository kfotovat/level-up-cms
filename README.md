# Level Up CMS

### Robust, multi-user CMS based on Python's Django framework

### Description:

Rebranded as Level Up!

  PositiveLevelSystem was a CMS built on spec to support behavioral consultation specialists in the educational sector. Scattered references to the original project name may be found throughout the codebase.
